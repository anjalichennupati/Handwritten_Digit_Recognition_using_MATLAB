This project demonstrates the usage of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) in handwritten digit recognition. The implementation process happens using an MNIST dataset. Various functions are implemented to provide the desired output with the highest accuracy. Activation functions work hand in hand along with polling and convolution to predict handwritten digits. Handwritten digit recognition finds its application in digitising documents and OCR recognition
